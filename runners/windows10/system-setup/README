Install instructions:
1. Create a new Windows 10 VM
2. Make the user auto-login with admin rights
3. Copy these files to C:\CI
4. Link "run.bat" into shell:startup
5. Disable UAC completly (mouse input is crap for automated setups)
6. Install "git" with minimum wrappers for the shell and "commit and checkout as-is"
